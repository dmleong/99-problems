The underdeveloped but upwardly mobile country of Galosh has need of a secret code in which to express its 
diplomatic dispatches, so the head cryptographer proposed that first, all sequences of nonvowels (including spaces 
and punctuation) be reversed. The letter “y” is NOT considered to be a vowel. Then, the entire string message 
should be written backwards.

A program is to be written so that a message sent from the Prime Minister to various aides can be decoded. Two 
examples of messages and their encoded versions are:

HELLO THERE.
.ERE THOLLEH

MAKE THAT EXTRA CHEESE. PEPPERONI GIVES ME HEARTBURN.
RN.URTBAE HES MEVI GINOREPPE. PESEE CHAXTRET A THEKAM

All messages will contain either the capital letters, digits (0-9) , a blank, or the following two punctuation 
characters: . , and will be restricted to at most 60 characters. Your program should accept any number of 
encoded messages from the file named message.dat and write their associated decoded results to the display.
