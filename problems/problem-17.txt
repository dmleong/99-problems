For this problem, you are to translate a paragraph of ordinary English text into Pig Latin. Unlike real Latin, the 
translation rules for Pig Latin are simple. 

• If a word starts with a consonant, then translate the word by placing the initial letter at the end of the word and 
appending “ay”. Example: cow becomes owcay and blank becomes lankay. 

• If a word starts with a vowel, then simply append “way” to the word. Example: apple beomes appleway and order 
becomes orderway.

The letter y should be considered to be a consonant.

The input format of the text is a series of lines, each line containing a set of words to be translated. A line 
containing five periods indicates the end of the data. For example,

the quick brown fox
jumped over the lazy dog
because it would not move

The name of a file containing the text will come into your program via argv[1].

Words will be separated by one or more blanks.

No other punctuation will be used.

Of course, the newline character \n is used to end a line.
