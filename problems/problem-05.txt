Multiplying the digits of an integer and continuing the process gives the surprising result that the sequence of 
products always arrives at a single digit number. For example, 

715 ---- 35 ---- 15
4000 ---- 0
9

The number of times products need to be calculated to reach a single digit is called the persistence number of that 
integer. Thus, the persistence number of 715 is 3, the persistence number of 27 is 2, the persistence number of 4000 
is 1, and the persistence number of 9 is 0.

You are to write an iterative program that will continually prompt the user to enter a positive integer until EOF has 
been entered via the keyboard. For each number entered your program should output the persistence of the number. 
Please note that the correct spelling of persistence is p-e-r-s-i-s-t-e-n-c-e. The word does not contain the letter “a”.
