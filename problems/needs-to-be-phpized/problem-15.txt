You are to write a C program that enters a positive integer via the command line. Remember this number comes 
into your program as a string. You should malloc up enough space to create an array big enough to hold n integers. 
You should call the random number generator, rand(), to fill that array with random numbers between 0 and 99,999. 
After the array has been filled, you should call a bubblesort sorting function which will sort the numbers into 
ascending order. Your program should output the smallest number, the largest number, and the median value of the 
numbers. Recall, that the median value of an odd number of numbers is the middle number. The median value of an 
even number of numbers is the average of the middle two numbers. The bubblesort algorithm you should write is a 
straight bubblesort -- like the one we discussed in class. Do not increased its speed with special optimizations.
